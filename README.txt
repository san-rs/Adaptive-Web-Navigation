Adaptive Web Navigation

This project is an adaptive Q&A web application based on Stack Overflow.
The front-end is done in React and the back-end is Node.js.
The database used is MongoDB and Elasticsearch is used to index data.

### Database:
Using Mongodb cloud server, hence no need to run mongodb instance from your computer. Connections are already made.

### Elastic Search: 
Has been setup in AWS cloud and connections given already.

Ensure node and npm are installed in the test system.

To run the project: Navigate to the correct folder. Run the below commands.
```npm install```
```npm run build```
```npm start```

Go to localhost:3000 in your browser, preferably Chrome.

This mode does not support hot-reloading. If you change server code, you need to restart the server manually.
